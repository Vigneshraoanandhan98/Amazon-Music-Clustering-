Amazon-Music-Clustering

📌 Project Overview

With millions of songs available on streaming platforms, manually categorizing tracks into genres or moods is nearly impossible.

This project applies Unsupervised Machine Learning (Clustering) to automatically group similar songs based on their audio characteristics 

such as:

🎧 Danceability

⚡ Energy

🔊 Loudness

🎤 Speechiness

🎼 Acousticness

🎹 Instrumentalness

💓 Valence

🥁 Tempo

⏱ Duration

The objective is to discover hidden patterns in music data and create meaningful clusters that can support recommendation systems, playlist generation, and music analytics.
